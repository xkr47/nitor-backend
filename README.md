Fully async rest and static file serving backend based on vert.x

## Installation

### Building
```sh
mvn clean package
```

### Running at port 443
```sh
mkdir -p /opt/nitor/backend
cp -a target/backend-1.0.0-fat.jar /opt/nitor/backend
cp -a certs /opt/nitor/backend
cp src/systemd/* /etc/systemd/system
systemd daemon-reload
systemd start nitor-backend.socket
```

## Goals

- single runnable Ã¼ber jar
- no need for apache/ngingx/varnish in front
- servers both static files and rest services

## Future goals
- make the stack more configurable so that it can be used in other projects too

Some features of apache/ngingx/varnish that might be useful to reimplement
- access log
- modifying/cleaning up of incoming requests
  - url, headers
- caching of dynamic content
  - cache to disk
  - on-the-fly compression
  - configurable cache key (query parameters, cookies, vary headers etc)
  - cache invalidation api
- authentication
  - TLS client certificate validation (done)
  - basic authentication
    - against ldap
- rate limiting

## Ideas
- define request handling attributes in yaml file
  - match rules and action rules
  - match against path/header/query parameter etc
  - actions can be
    - cache (with settings x)
    - cors (with settings x)
  - or is it better to have just a fluent api?
